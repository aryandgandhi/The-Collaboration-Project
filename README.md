# The-Collaboration-Project
A centralized area to find projects from others and collaborate with 

***I wrote a longer read me, I am going to put it in "LONGEREADME.md," this read me explains the porject break down, takes ~3 minutes to read ***

Target Audience:
 1. People looking to just build shit
 2. People looking for SWE internships and wanting to build a project (that will go somewhere)
 3. People looking to meet others at a similar CS level as them
 4. People looking to get experience in open source with a lower barrier of entry
 5. Peoe

Why?
 1. Open up building to collaboration amongst students and young professionals
 2. Make open source easier to enter
 3. Meet people interested in building cool shit
 4. No need to start projects from scratch (good chance you won't be doing that at your job)
